# Connect-4 on Rails

## Requirements

- Level 1: Build a playable game of Connect 4 with 2 players, a command line
  interface being fine.  Should have player moves, win detection logic,
  tie detection, etc.  
- Level 2: Implement a standard “AI” for the computer player. A standard
  computer opponent should block a human from winning when able to, but
  plays more ad hoc and does not operate with an advanced strategy.
- Level 3:  Make it playable online (Heroku or similar) with a SPA web
  interface, games persisting to a database,  etc.
- `Boss Level (Bonus)`: the computer player's decision engine should have
  a setting for smarter vs standard opponent. The smarter version should
  employ any sort of intelligent strategy or look-ahead approach you choose,
  and be able to win most times (assuming it goes first and it’s not playing
  against a player with the same strategy), though it does not have to play
  mathematically perfectly.
